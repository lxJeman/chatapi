Make a GPT Wrapper, with similar UI to ChatGPT.com and the idea being that up right there will be a setting logo on witch you click it it will open a pop-up witch asks for the openai api key:

# TODO
- Create a simple UI similar to ChatGPT.com
- Add a settings icon in the top right corner
- Implement a pop-up that prompts for OpenAI API key input
- Store the API key securely (consider using environment variables or secure storage)
- Ensure the application can make API calls to OpenAI using the provided key
- Handle errors gracefully (e.g., invalid API key, network issues)
- Test the application to ensure it works as expected
- Consider adding features like saving the API key for future sessions
- Document the code and provide instructions for users on how to set up and use the application
- Optionally, implement a way to clear or update the API key
- Ensure the UI is responsive and works well on different screen sizes
- Consider adding a loading indicator while waiting for API responses
- Implement basic styling to make the UI visually appealing
